# KeyServ

Learning Django with fake applications
======================================

##Why
=====

The purpose of this application is solely for learning Django development using a basic app concept.

### The app explained
=====================

The purpose of this site/app is to host GPG keys uploaded to facilitate encrypted communications between site users.

Currently, the only available actions on the site are to view already uploaded keys.

#### TODO
---------

+ ~~Implement bootstrap~~
+ Add forms for key/message uploads
+ Tinker with/learn bootstrap for visual appeal
+ Break out elements (submenus, etc.) into their own template files for importing/including
+ Secure secret key & other sensitive variables (until then **do not deploy** to web, it's dangerous!)
